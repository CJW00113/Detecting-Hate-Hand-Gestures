# Detecting-Hate-Hand-Gestures
YOLO-based Detection of Hate Hand Gestures

The project was created with the aim of easily detecting hate hand gestures.

We can detect the respective hand gesture using YOLO and display it as a bounding box.

This means that using YOLO, we can detect hand gestures and generate bounding boxes around them to display on the screen.

We used Google Colab Notebooks and confirmed this with OpenCV.
